# Bedrock Break Helper

* Help you breaking bedrocks using newcake's [method](https://youtu.be/Tu4C3QNBdRY).
* Use grave key to toggle it in default.
* If [malilib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib) is installed, you can see boxes near pistons.
  - Green box for possible positions, and blue box for correctly placed redstone blocks.
* But you still can use it without malilib. Press F3 and there is text near the screen center.
  - It tells which direction(s) to place redstone block. If there's one placed, there will be a "+" after direction.
  - The direction you're facing will be green.

Use the code from Fallen-Breath's [calculator](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/IronHeadHelper)
